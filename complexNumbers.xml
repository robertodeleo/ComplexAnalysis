	Short answer: No! Why we cannot avoid dealing with complex numbers is a non-trivial question with many answers from different fields.
	The one we will provide here is the very first one that appeared in literature and that lead directly to the development
	of the study of	this very field of study.
      </p>
      <p>
	Complex numbers appeared for the first time in literature in 16-th century in connection with the problem of solving
	3-rd degree polynomial equations. The history of the discovery of this celebrated formula is quite complicated
	(the curious reader can get many full details in the increasingly more detailed publications
	<xref ref="bib-Mer06" />,  <xref ref="bib-Gav12" />,  <xref ref="bib-Tos20" />)
	and involves several of the strongest mathematicians of that century: Scipione del Ferro, Niccol√≤ Tartaglia and Gerolamo
	Cardano.
      </p>
      <p>
	According to Cardano's favorite pupil, L. Ferrari (to whom, incidentally, is due the formula for the solution of
	4-th degree polynomial equations), the formula first appeared in a publication of del Ferro, now lost, dating
	about 1515 but the book that most contributed to make them available to the mathematical community is Cardano's
	<url href="http://www.filosofia.unimi.it/cardano/testi/operaomnia/vol_4_s_4.pdf">Ars Magna</url>. Published in Latin
	in 1545 (see <xref ref="bib-Car07" /> for a translation in English), this book is considered one of the greatest
	scientific treatises of the early Renaissance.

      <p>
	In his Ars Magna, Cardano noticed that, in some particular case(s? **because of the word some), his formula included
	the square root of a negative number, even though (some/all?) solutions are real. He called (this/these?) cases <term>irreducible</term>. 
	One can now check this easily as follows. 	
	It was well-known, even during Cardano's time, the quadratic term of the general cubic equation
	<men>x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0</men>
	can be eliminated by the translation <m>y=x-a/3</m> to consider, WLOG, the so-called
	<term>depressed cubic</term>
	<men xml:id="eq-cubic">x^3+px+q=0.</men>
	In 1680, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhausen started experimenting with higher degrees using transformations
	hoping to find a resolution formula for quintics. In case of cubics, his idea amounts to setting
	<men xml:id="eq-TschTr">y-(x^2+rx+s)=0</men> and to determine <m>y</m> so that the
	<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant">resultant</url> of the polynomials (in <m>x</m>)
	at the l.h.s. of Eqs. <xref ref="eq-cubic" /> and <xref ref="eq-TschTr" /> is zero, namely the two equations have a common root.

      The resultant is a cubic polynomial in <m>y</m>
	and the two degrees of freedom
	<m>r</m> and <m>s</m> can be chosen so that the coefficients of its terms of degree 1 and 2 are zero: 
        <sage language="sage"> 
          <input>
var('x,y,p,q,r,s')
cb = x^3 + p*x + q
res = cb.resultant(y-x^2-r*x-s,x).poly(y)
sol = solve([res.coefficient(y,1),res.coefficient(y,2)],
            [r,s],
            solution_dict=True)
(res,sol)
          </input>
          <output>
(q*r^3 - p*r^2*s + p*q*r - p^2*s - 3*q*r*s + 2*p*s^2 - s^3 + (2*p - 3*s)*y^2 + y^3 - q^2 + (p*r^2 + p^2 + 3*q*r - 4*p*s + 3*s^2)*y,
[{r: -1/6*(9*q + sqrt(12*p^3 + 81*q^2))/p, s: 2/3*p},
 {r: -1/6*(9*q - sqrt(12*p^3 + 81*q^2))/p, s: 2/3*p}])
	  </output>                                                                                                       
        </sage>   
	The problem is the square root in the expression of <m>r</m>: a cubic has always at least a real root but when <m>4a^3+27b^2 \lt 0</m>
	this method expresses even that root through complex numbers! In particular, <m>4a^3+27b^2</m> is always negative when Eq. <xref ref="eq-cubic" />
	has a single root, namely when its local maximum and minimum have the same sign.
	Cardano tried unsuccesfully for the rest of his life to find a formula without this problem.
	<term>In fact, it was proved three centuries later [add ref!!!] that there is no way to avoid
	the appearance of complex numbers in the resolution formulae for cubics and quartics.</term>
      </p>
      <p>
	A contemporary of Cardano, named Rafael Bombelli, decided instead to embrace this feature of the solving formula for cubic (and quartic)
	polynomials and started the study of the algebra of what are now known as <em>complex numbers</em>. In particular, his main work 
	"L'Algebra" <xref ref="bib-Bom79" />
	is considered the book where complex numbers where first introduced in literature; it is in this book that appear first
	the signs rules for the multiplication of any two among <m>\pm1,\pm i</m>.
	More information on Bombelli and his work can be found in <xref ref="bib-Gav12" />,  <xref ref="bib-LM02" /> and <xref ref="bib-Gav13" />.

        <title>Construction of <m>\Bbb C</m></title>

	<p>From elementary Algebra, we know the <em>imaginary unit</em>, <m>i</m>, has property
            <me>i^2=-1</me>.
	<m>\Bbb C</m> is an extension field of the <m>\Bbb R</m>, which means <m>\Bbb C</m> inherits the arithmetic operations from <m>\Bbb R</m>, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by any complex number except 0.
	If we multiply <m>i</m> by <m>\beta</m> then add <m>\alpha</m>, where <m>\beta</m>,<m>\alpha \in \Bbb R</m>, we consider <m>\alpha</m> the <em>real part</em> and <m>\beta</m> the <em>imaginary part</em> obtaining the complex number <m>\alpha + i\beta</m>.
	If say <m>\alpha = 0</m>, then the complex number is <em>purely imaginary</em>. The only number that is a real number and purely imaginary is zero. We also say that two complex numbers are equal if and only if they have the same real and imaginary parts.
        We not look at the extended operations on <m>\Bbb C</m>.
		
        We first look at addition where 
            <md><mrow>(\alpha + i\beta) + (\gamma + i\delta) &amp; = \alpha + \gamma + i\beta + i\delta</mrow>
		    <mrow>&amp; = (\alpha + \gamma) + i (\beta + \delta)</mrow></md>
	We also can negate the sign and the following property holds for subtraction.
	We now observe multiplication where
	    <mrow>(\alpha + i\beta)(\gamma + i\delta) &amp; = \alpha\gamma + i\beta\gamma + i\delta\alpha + i^2\beta\delta</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = (\alpha\gamma - \beta\delta) + i (\beta\gamma + \delta\alpha)</mrow>, since <m>i^2=-1</m>.
	Division is not as simple and we have to take not that for two complex numbers to be equal, their parts must also be equal. The idea behind division is to show if we divide complex numbers, where the complex number in the denominator is nonzero, we should obtain another complex number (ie. <m>\frac{(\alpha + i\beta)}{(\gamma + i\delta)} = x + iy</m>, where <m>x,y \in \BbbR</m> and <m>\gamma + i\delta \neq 0</m>).
	    <mrow>\frac{(\alpha + i\beta)}{(\gamma + i\delta)} &amp; = x + iy</mrow>
            <mrow>(\alpha + i\beta) &amp; = (x + iy)(\gamma + i\delta)</mrow>
	    <mrow>(\alpha + i\beta) &amp; = (x\gamma - y\delta) + i(x\delta + y\gamma)</mrow>
	This now forms a system of linear equations, given the fact parts must be equal, giving
	    <mrow>\alpha &amp; = x\gamma - y\delta</mrow>
	    <mrow>\beta &amp; = x\delta + y\gamma</mrow>
	Solving for both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, obtaining
	    <mrow>\alpha &amp; = x\gamma - y\delta</mrow>
	    <mrow>\alpha + y\delta &amp; = x\gamma</mrow>
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\alpha + y\delta}{\gamma}</mrow>
	and 
	    <mrow>\beta &amp; = x\delta + y\gamma</mrow>
	    <mrow>\beta - x\delta &amp; = y\gamma</mrow>
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\beta - x\delta}{\gamma} </mrow>.
	From here, we can now solve full for both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> giving
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\alpha + y\delta}{\gamma}</mrow>
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\alpha + (\frac{\beta - x\delta}{\gamma})\delta}{\gamma}</mrow>
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\frac{\alpha\gamma}{\gamma} + \frac{\delta\beta - x\delta^2}{\gamma})}{\gamma}</mrow>
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\frac{\alpha\gamma + \delta\beta - x\delta^2}{\gamma})}{\gamma}</mrow>
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\alpha\gamma + \delta\beta - x\delta^2}{\gamma^2}</mrow>
	    <mrow>x\gamma^2 &amp; = \alpha\gamma + \delta\beta - x\delta^2</mrow>
	    <mrow>x\gamma^2 + x\delta^2 &amp; = \alpha\gamma + \delta\beta</mrow>
	    <mrow>x(\gamma^2 + \delta^2) &amp; = \alpha\gamma + \delta\beta</mrow>
	    <mrow>x &amp; = \frac{\alpha\gamma + \delta\beta}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2}</mrow>
	giving
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\beta - x\delta}{\gamma} </mrow>
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\beta - (\frac{\alpha\gamma + \delta\beta}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2})\delta}{\gamma} </mrow>
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\frac{\beta(\gamma^2 + \delta^2)}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2} - \frac{\alpha\gamma\delta + \delta^2\beta}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2}}{\gamma} </mrow>
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\frac{\beta\gamma^2 + \beta\delta^2 - \alpha\gamma\delta - \delta^2\beta}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2}}{\gamma} </mrow>
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\beta\gamma^2 - \alpha\gamma\delta}{(\gamma^2 + \delta^2)\gamma} </mrow>
	    <mrow>y&amp; = \frac{\beta\gamma - \alpha\delta}{(\gamma^2 + \delta^2)} </mrow>.
	Since <m>(\gamma + i\delta) \neq 0</m>, we know <m>(\gamma^2 + \delta^2) \new 0</m>. Therefore, 
	    <mrow>\frac{(\alpha + i\beta)}{(\gamma + i\delta)} &amp; = (\frac{\alpha\gamma + \delta\beta}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2}) + i(\frac{\beta\gamma - \alpha\delta}{(\gamma^2 + \delta^2)})</mrow>.
	We can see that <m>\gamma^2 + \delta^2 \in \Bbb R</m>, so we can solve the division operation easily by multiplying by <m>\gamma - i\delta</m>, which will cancel the imaginary unit since <m>i^2=-1</m>.
	So, 
	    <mrow>\frac{(\alpha + i\beta)}{(\gamma + i\delta)} = \frac{(\alpha + i\beta)(\gamma - i\delta)}{(\gamma + i\delta)(\gamma - i\delta)} = (\frac{\alpha\gamma + \delta\beta}{\gamma^2 + \delta^2}) + i(\frac{\beta\gamma - \alpha\delta}{(\gamma^2 + \delta^2)})</mrow>.
	We can use this same process to find the special case of the reciprocal of a complex number to be
	    <me>\frac{1}{\alpha + i\beta}=\frac{\alpha -i\beta}{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}</me>.
	As mentioned, <m>i^2=-1</m>. This leads to <m>i^3=i^2\cdot i=-i</m>, <m>i^4=i^2 \cdot i^2=-1\cdot-1=1=i^0</m>. From this, we can observe that the multiplication of <m>i</m> to itself <m>n</m> times, where <m>n</m> is an integer, is equivalent to either 1, <m>i</m>, <m>-1</m>, and <m>-i</m> which corresponds when <m>n = \{0,1,2,3\}</m>.
	So we can say if <m>n\mod 4 = 0</m>, then <m>i^n=1</m>, if <m>n\mod 4 = 1</m>, then <m>i^n=i</m>, if <m>n\mod 4 = 2</m>, then <m>i^n=-1</m>, and finally if <m>n\mod 4 = 3</m>, then <m>i^n=-i</m>.


        This is exactly the formula for the <m>(n + 1)</m>th case.</p>

        <p>This method of proof is known as <term>mathematical induction</term>.  Instead of attempting to verify a statement about some subset <m>S</m> of the positive integers <m>{\mathbb N}</m> on a case-by-case basis, an impossible task if <m>S</m> is an infinite set, we give a specific proof for the smallest integer being considered, followed by a generic argument showing that if the statement holds for a given case, then it must also hold for the next  case in the sequence.  We summarize mathematical induction in the following axiom. </p>

Assume that if <m>S</m> contains an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>1 \leq k \leq n</m>, then <m>S</m> contains a least element.  We will show that if a set <m>S</m> contains an integer less than or equal to <m>n + 1</m>, then <m>S</m> has a least element.  If <m>S</m> does not contain an integer less than <m>n+1</m>, then <m>n+1</m> is the smallest integer in <m>S</m>.  Otherwise, since <m>S</m> is nonempty, <m>S</m> must contain an integer less than or equal to <m>n</m>. In this case, by induction, <m>S</m> contains a least element.</p>

        <p>Induction can also be very useful in formulating definitions. For instance, there are two ways to define <m>n!</m>, the factorial of a positive integer <m>n</m>.<ul>
            <li><p>The <em>explicit</em> definition: <m>n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n - 1) \cdot n</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <em>inductive</em> or <em>recursive</em> definition: <m>1! = 1</m> and <m>n! = n(n - 1)!</m> for <m>n \gt 1</m>.</p></li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Every good mathematician or computer scientist knows that looking at problems recursively, as opposed to explicitly, often results in better understanding of complex issues.</p>

            <title>The Sieve of Eratosthenes</title>
            <idx><h>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h></idx>  
            <statement>
                <p>One method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a certain fixed positive integer <m>N</m> is to list all of the numbers <m>n</m> such that <m>1 \lt n \lt N</m>.  Begin by eliminating all of the multiples of 2.  Next eliminate all of the multiples of 3. Now eliminate all of the  multiples of 5.  Notice that 4 has already been crossed out.  Continue in this manner, noticing that we do not have to go all the way to <m>N</m>; it suffices to stop at <m>\sqrt{N}</m>. Using this method, compute all of the prime numbers less than <m>N = 250</m>.  We can also use this method to find all of the integers that are relatively prime to an integer <m>N</m>.  Simply eliminate the prime factors of <m>N</m> and all of their multiples.  Using this method, find all of the numbers that are relatively prime to <m>N= 120</m>.  Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, write a program that will compute all of the primes less than an integer <m>N</m>. </p>
            </statement>

        <exercise>
            <idx><h>Ackermann's function</h></idx>
            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>{\mathbb N}^0 = {\mathbb N} \cup \{ 0 \}</m>. Ackermann's function is the function <m>A :{\mathbb N}^0 \times {\mathbb N}^0 \rightarrow {\mathbb N}^0</m> defined by the equations<md>
                    <mrow>A(0, y) &amp; = y + 1</mrow>
                    <mrow>A(x + 1, 0) &amp; = A(x, 1)</mrow>
                    <mrow>A(x + 1, y + 1) &amp; = A(x, A(x + 1, y))</mrow>
                </md>.</p>

                <p>Use this definition to compute <m>A(3, 1)</m>.  Write a program to evaluate Ackermann's function.  Modify the  program to count the number of statements executed in the program when Ackermann's function is evaluated.  How many statements are executed in the evaluation of <m>A(4, 1)</m>?  What about <m>A(5, 1)</m>?</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Write a computer program that will implement the Euclidean algorithm.  The program should accept two positive integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as input and should output <m>\gcd( a,b)</m> as well as integers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that 
                    <me>\gcd( a,b) = ra + sb</me>.</p>
