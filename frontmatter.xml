        <p>Robert Beezer encouraged me to make <em>Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications</em> available as an open source textbook, a decision that I have never regretted.  With his assistance, the book has been rewritten in PreTeXt (<url href="https://pretextbook.org">https://pretextbook.org</url>), making it possible to quickly output print, web, PDF versions and more from the same source.  The open source version of this book has received support from the National Science Foundation (Award #DUE-1020957).</p>

        <p>This real text has been used as the basis of a sample book for testing <pretext />.  So it is slowly migrating away from what the real book looks like and should not be construed as representative.  For example, we have reduced the book to four chapters.  Indeed, that previous sentence was more an excuse to test some cross-references with parts in the structural case, such as this one to DeMoivre's Theorem, <!--xref ref="theorem-demoivre" /-->.</p>

        <p>Though there are no specific prerequisites for a course in abstract algebra, students who have had other higher-level courses in mathematics will generally be more prepared than those who have not, because they will possess a bit more mathematical sophistication. Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an elementary knowledge of matrices and determinants. This should present no great problem, since most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices and determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already taken a sophomore or junior-level course in linear algebra.</p>

        <p>Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text. An exercise set appears at the end of each chapter. The nature of the exercises ranges over several categories; computational,  conceptual, and theoretical problems are included. A section presenting hints and solutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text. Often in the solutions a proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student to provide the details. The exercises range in difficulty from very easy to very challenging. Many of the more substantial problems require careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the 	solution is not forthcoming after a few minutes of work.</p>
