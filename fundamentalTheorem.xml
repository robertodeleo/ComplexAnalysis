    <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Complex Analysis and its immediate consequences</title>

    <introduction>
      
      In this chapter we are going to illustrate how strong is the property of being complex-differentiable
      for a map <m>\Bbb R^2\to\Bbb R^2</m>. In comparison with differentiability of maps <m>\Bbb R\to\Bbb R</m>,
      the complex counterpart turns out to be extremely more rigid. We will ultimately show that a map
      that is complex-differentiable over an open set is actually <em>analytic</em> on that very set.

      <title>Some relevant spaces of differentiable maps</title>

      <definition>
	Given two open sets <m>V\subset K^n</m> and <m>W\subset K^m</m>, where <m>K</m> is either <m>\Bbb R</m>
	or <m>\Bbb C</m>, we denote by <me>D^k(V,W)</me> the space of all maps <m>V\to W</m> that are differentiable
	<m>k</m> times at every point of <m>V</m> and by <me>C^k(V,W)</me> the subset of <m>D^k(V,W)</m> of those maps
	whose <m>k</m>-th derivative is continuous.
	When <m>m=1</m>, maps are just called functions and often the second space is omitted in the notation:
	<m>D^k(V)</m> and <m>C^k(V)</m> are the spaces of functions <m>V\to K</m>.
      </definition>

      <p>
	Since differentiabilty implies continuity, clearly <m>C^{k-1}(V)\supset D^k(V)</m>.
	More generally, 
	<me>
	  C^0(V)\supset D^1(V)\supset C^1(V)\supset D^2(V)\supset C^2(V)\supset\dots\supset D^k(V)\supset C^k(V)\supset\dots

	while <m>D^\infty(V)=C^\infty(V)</m>.

	In the real case, these spaces are all distinct.

      </theorem>

      <p>
	We shall prove below the fundamental theorem by showing the following chain of implications:
	<m>2\implies3\implies4\implies5\implies6\implies7\implies8\implies1\implies9\implies10\implies2</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<m>2\implies3</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Since <m>f(z)</m> is <m>C^1</m> as a complex function, then its components <m>u(x,y),v(x,y)</m> are
	<m>C^1</m> as real functions.
	The existence of <m>\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h}</m>, <m>z_0=x_0+iy_0</m>,
	implies that this limit	does not depend on how <m>h</m> approaches 0.
	<p>
	  Take first <m>h=\varepsilon</m>. Then
	<me>
	  \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}
	  =
	</me>
	<me>
	  =
	  \lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\frac{u(x_0+\varepsilon,y_0)-u(x_0,y_0)}{\varepsilon}+i\frac{v(x_0+\varepsilon,y_0)-v(x_0,y_0)}{\varepsilon}
	  =
	</me>
	<me>
	  =u_x(x_0,y_0) + i v_x(x_0,y_0),
	</me>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Now take <m>h=i\varepsilon</m>. Then
	<me>
	  \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}=
	</me>
	<me>
	  =
	  \lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\frac{u(x_0,y_0+\varepsilon)-u(x_0,y_0)}{i\varepsilon}+i\frac{v(x_0,y_0+\varepsilon)-v(x_0,y_0)}{i\varepsilon} =
	</me>
	<me>
	  =
	  -iu_y(x_0,y_0) +  v_y(x_0,y_0).	  
	</me>
	</p>
	By comparing these two expressions we get the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>3\implies4</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	<m>df=f_z dz + f_{\bar z} d\bar z = (u_x+iv_x)dx+i(u_y+iv_y)dy</m>, so
	<me>
	  f_{\bar z} = \frac{1}{2}\left[(u_x-v_y)+i(v_x+u_y)\right] = 0.
	</me>
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>4\implies5</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Since <m>dz\wedge dz</m>, <m>d(fdz)=(f_z dz + f_{\bar z} d\bar z)\wedge dz = f_{\bar z}d\bar z\wedge dz = 0</m>.
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>5\implies6</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Since <m>d(fdz)=0</m> and <m>\frac{1}{z-z_0}</m> is holomorphic (where defined), also
	also <m>d\left(\frac{f(z)}{z-z_0}dz\right)=0</m>. For <m>r</m> small enough,
	<m>\frac{f(z)}{z-z_0}</m> is holomorphic in <m>|z-z_0|\lt r</m>, <m>z\neq z_0</m>,
	so that
	<me>
	  \int\limits_{C_z(r)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}d\zeta
	  -
	  \int\limits_{C_z(\varepsilon)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}d\zeta
	  =
	  \int\limits_{\varepsilon\lt|\zeta-z_0|\lt r}d\left(\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}d\zeta\right)=0
	</me>
	for every <m>\varepsilon\lt r</m>. 
	Since <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>, on <m>|z-z_0|=\varepsilon</m> we have that
	<m>f(\zeta)=f(z_0)+\varepsilon g(\zeta)</m>, with <m>\lim_{\zeta\to z_0}g(\zeta)=0</m>.
	Hence
	<me>
	  \lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\int\limits_{C_z(\varepsilon)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}d\zeta
	  =
	  \int\limits_{C_z(\varepsilon)}\frac{f(z_0)}{\zeta-z_0}d\zeta
	  +
	  \lim_{\varepsilon\to0}\varepsilon\int\limits_{C_z(\varepsilon)}\frac{g(\zeta)}{\zeta-z_0}d\zeta
	  =
	  2\pi i f(z_0)
	</me>
	and the Cauchy integral formula follows.
<!--
	Since <m>fdz</m> is closed, it is locally exact. Namely, close to any point <m>z_0\in\Omega</m>,
	<m>fdz=dF</m> for some <m>C^1</m> function <m>F</m>.
	Since <m>dF=F'dz</m> then, close to <m>z_0</m>, <m>F'=f</m>.
-->
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>6\implies7</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	<p>
	We can prove WLOG the theorem for <m>z_0=0</m>, so that
	<me>\displaystyle f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\!\int\limits_{C_0(r)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta</me>
	for <m>|z|</m> small enough. Notice that, since <m>\zeta\in C_0(r)</m>, <m>|z|\lt|\zeta|</m> and so
	<me>\frac{1}{\zeta-z} = \frac{1}{\zeta}\frac{1}{1-\frac{z}{\zeta}}=\frac{1}{\zeta}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{z}{\zeta}\right)^n,</me> 
	which converges uniformly in <m>\zeta</m> over compacts.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Hence, for all <m>z</m> close enough to 0,
	  <me>
	    \displaystyle f(z)
	    =
	    \frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\!\int\limits_{C_0(r)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta
	    =
	    \frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\!\int\limits_{C_0(r)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{z}{\zeta}\right)^nd\zeta
	    =
	    \sum_{n=0}^\infty\left[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\!\int\limits_{C_0(r)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta^{n+1}}d\zeta\right]\cdot z^n.
	  </me>
	</p>
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>7\implies8</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Since <m>f</m> is <m>C^\infty</m> by hypothesis, <m>fdz</m> is closed and so it is locally exact,
	namely locally <m>fdz=dF</m> for some holomorphich map <m>F</m>. Since <m>dF=F'dz</m>,
	it follows that locally <m>f=F'</m>.
      </proof>
<!--      
      <p>
	<m>8\implies9</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Suppose that, close to <m>z_0\in\Omega</m>, <m>f=F'</m> for some <m>C^1</m> map <m>F</m>.
	Since we already proved that <m>2\implies6</m>, <m>F</m> is <m>C^\infty</m> and so
	<m>f</m> is also <m>C^\infty</m> and, in particular, holomorphic. Hence <m>fdz</m> is closed
	and the claim follows.
      </proof>
-->      
      <p>
	<m>8\implies1</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Suppose that, close to <m>z_0\in\Omega</m>, <m>f=F'</m> for some <m>C^1</m> map <m>F</m>.
	Since we already proved that <m>2\implies6</m>, <m>F</m> is <m>C^\infty</m> and so
	<m>f</m> is also <m>C^\infty</m> and, in particular, holomorphic.

      <p>
	<m>1\implies9</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	  The proof of this statement is due to Goursat <em>[ADD CITATION]</em>. It is a very noteworthy argument
	  because it shows that, at least in dimension 2, the <m>C^1</m> assumption on the regularity of the form in
	  Stokes theorem can be weakened to <m>D^1</m>.

	  [ADD PROOF]
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>9\implies10</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Since the integral of <m>fdz</m> is zero on every contractible loop, we can build a holomorphic
	antiderivative close to any point <m>z_0\in\Omega</m> by defining <m>F(z)=\int_{z_0}^zf(z)dz</m>,
	where the integral is taken over any piecewise-<m>C^1</m> loop starting at <m>z_0</m> and ending at
	<m>z</m>. This definition is well-posed because, close enough to any given point, all loops are contractible
	and so the value of <m>F(z)</m> does not depend on the path. Hence <m>f</m> is analytic.

	<p>
	Let <m>\Gamma</m> a piecewise-<m>C^1</m> loop inside <m>\Omega</m> containing <m>K</m> in its interior.
	Notice that such loop can be easily built by introducing a grid in <m>\Omega</m> [ADD PICTURE!!].
	Then, since <m>f</m> is, in particular, <m>C^1</m>, it follows from <m>2\implies6</m> that
	<me>\displaystyle f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\!\!\int\limits_{C_0(r)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta</me>
	for each <m>z\in K</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This integral can be approximated uniformly by Riemann sums by choosing some finite number
	  of points on <m>\Gamma</m>. Each summand is a rational function with a pole on <m>\Gamma</m>, so this way
	  we can build a sequence of rational functions converging uniformly to <m>f</m> on <m>K</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The fact that every rational function with a pole in some component of <m>\overline{\Bbb C}\setminus K</m>
	  can be uniformly approximated in <m>K</m> by a sequence of rational functions having as pole a given
	  point of that same component was proven in [ADD THIS THM IN THE POWER SERIES CHAPTER!!]
	  <!-- 
	  We still have to prove that every rational function with a pole in some component of <m>\Bbb C\setminus K</m>
	  can be uniformly approximated in <m>K</m> by a sequence of rational functions having as pole a given
	  point of that same component.
	  -->
	</p>
      </proof>
      
      <p>
	<m>10\implies2</m>
      </p>
      <proof>
	Since the convergence is uniform over compacts and every rational function is analytic, their limit is analytic
	and, in particolar, is <m>C^1</m>.
      </proof>

      <p>
	Before discussing the many important consequences of this theorem, several remarks are in order.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<term>Cauchy's Theorem.</term>
	Implication <m>1\implies9</m> is known as Cauchy Theorem. Cauchy's original proof, first published in 1825 <xref ref="bib-Cau25" />
	and improved in 1846 <xref ref="bib-Cau46" />, as well as Riemann's version published in 1851  <xref ref="bib-Rie51" />,
	actually only covered the weaker statement <m>2\implies9</m>, namely assumed the function to have continuous derivative.
	In this case, the theorem is a direct consequence of Stoke's theorem <m>\int_{\partial D}\omega=\int_Dd\omega</m> (also called
	Green's theorem when <m>\omega</m> is a 1-form and <m>D</m> is a 2-dimensional open set).
      </p>
      <p>
	The missing step, allowing to prove
	9 using only the differentiability hypothesis, was found in 1900 by Edouard Goursat <xref ref="bib-Gou00" />.
	See <xref ref="bib-Sco78" /> for a thorough account of the history of this theorem.
      </p>

      <p>
	<term>Cauchy-Riemann equations.</term>
	Equations in staments 3 and 4 are known as, respectively, the real and complex version of the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
	Clearly in statement 4 we are assuming that <m>f</m> is complex differentiable. In statement 3, though, we are not and
	its equivalence with statament 1 shows that the real Cauchy-Riemann equations, together with the continuity of the
	partial derivatives of the components of <m>f</m>, are equivalent to the holomorphicity of <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Lot of efforts were put into finding the weakest possible hypotheses granting the holomorphicity of <m>f</m> for functions
	satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
	One of the best results in this direction is the following:
	<theorem>
	  <p>
	    <term>[Looman-Menchoff, 1936 <xref ref="bib-Men36" />]</term> Assume that <m>f</m> is continuous and that
	    <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> have partial derivatives everywhere but for a countable set of points in <m>\Omega</m>
	    and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations wherever they exist. Then <m>f</m> is holomorphic.
	  </p>
	</theorem>
	Notice that the continuity assumption on <m>f</m> cannot be dropped:
	<example>
	  <term>[Looman, 1923 <xref ref="bib-Loo23" />]</term>
	  <p>
	    The function
	    <me>
	      f(z) = \begin{cases}e^{-z^4},&amp;z\neq0\cr 0,&amp;z=0\cr\end{cases}
	    </me>
	    satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at every point but it is not continuous (and so certainly not even holomorphic)
	    at <m>z=0</m>.
	  </p>
	</example>
	We also remind the reader that it is essential that the derivatives of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> exist over an open set,
	rather than at isolated points,	as next example shows:
	<example>
	  <term>[Derrick, 1972 <xref ref="bib-Der72" />]</term>
	  <p>
	    The function
	    <me>
	      f(z) = \begin{cases}\frac{z^5}{|z|^4},&amp;z\neq0\cr 0,&amp;z=0\cr\end{cases}
	    </me>
	    is continuous everywhere and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at <m>z=0</m> but it is
	    not holomorphic at any point.
	  </p>
	</example>
	For a thorough discussion about weaker conditions granting the holomorphicity of a function,
	see Gray and Morris <xref ref="bib-GM78" />.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<term>Morera's Theorem.</term>
	A stronger version of implication <m>9\implies1</m>, converse of Cauchy Theorem, was first found by Giacinto Morera in 1886
	<xref ref="bib-Mor86" />:
	if a continuous function <m>f</m> satisfies <m>\int_\gamma fdz=0</m> for every loop in <m>\Omega</m>, then
	<m>f</m> is holomorphic. This is not equivalent to Cauchy Theorem because the condition that the integral be zero
	on <em>every</em> close loop is not necessary for the holomorphicity of the function. For instance, <m>f(z)=1/z</m>
	is holomorphic in <m>\Bbb C\setminus\{0\}</m> but <m>\int_{C_0(r)} dz/z=2\pi i</m> for every <m>r>0</m>.

                <p>One method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a certain fixed positive integer <m>N</m> is to list all of the numbers <m>n</m> such that <m>1 \lt n \lt N</m>.

                <p>Use this definition to compute <m>A(3, 1)</m>.  Write a program to evaluate Ackermann's function.  Modify the  program to count the number of statements executed in the program when Ackermann's function is evaluated.  How many statements are executed in the evaluation of <m>A(4, 1)</m>?  What about <m>A(5, 1)</m>?</p>
